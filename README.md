# Snake-Game

## Eat. Grow. Repeat.
You’ll start each game with a blue snake and one fruit at random position. Move the snake around the screen and eat as many fruits as you can until the screen is full of the snake’s body.
Each time fruit is eaten, the snake will grow. 

## How To Play Snake </br>
There are only two rules you must follow when playing: don’t hit a wall and don’t bite your own tail. Crashing into a wall or your tail will end the game immediately. 
Your score is calculated based on the number of squares you added to the snake. You win the game when there is no more room for your snake to grow. 

### Move Fast, Think Fast!
